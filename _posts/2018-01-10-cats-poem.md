Oâ€™Malley pleased me with ancient tremblors 
stirred cream in secret crevices
depapered my wall

His lazy keys banged a tarantella story
a potential disney masterpiece
at every corner

His arched back was an unending broken prowl
a daydream long forgotten
ferns and vines

Semaphoric interpretive sniff
one inch from the point of tears
or howls

All along collecting whiskered trophies
a lonely dinner for one
the secret life of cogs

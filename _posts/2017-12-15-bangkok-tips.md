info I wish I would have found on some website somewhere else

* all boat transportation is amazing — canal boat especially. We got on [here](https://goo.gl/maps/czxQ2D8d4xq) heading west. convenient too.

* the skytrain is easy to use, has great views.

* the malls all have clean, free bathrooms; just follow the signs

* even if your airbnb condo has a big scary sign about airbnb in the lobby, nobody seems to care.

* not as many people speak helpful english as everyone claims

* any massage place with a bunch of good reviews is worth trying to book in advance unless you just want a foot massage. also, trying to find a place to just massage for 30 minutes is a weird thing to do unless you’re in the khao san road area.

* uber works but not a lot of people use it; hailing a cab can be much faster.

* 7–11 runs this town

* alcohol is illegal to sell after midnight, and sometimes in the afternoon too. some bars can sell late. relative to western prices, it’s not as cheap as the food.

* most things shut down around 2am. this city does sleep.

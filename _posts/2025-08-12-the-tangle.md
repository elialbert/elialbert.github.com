all of humandom is a tangled mane

all burrs and matted 

intractable. 

any single knot would pick right out 

if we could find the ends

and hold on

but we can’t:

the ends are thousands of other knots away.  

nevertheless we try

and we try

and the tangle grows 

so even the simplest start

way down by a shoulder blade 

enmeshes us more. 

is it any wonder that some people

given the power

reach for the knife?

that the best of us

watching this blood-soaked knife draw near

try only halfheartedly to stop it

limp wrist outstretched

while a guilty thrill whispers: “change”?

after a lifetime of filthy knots

why not cut just to see

what’s underneath.

So this person knows how to take a photo of a mirror at an angle, but deliberately posed their dog to hold the phone, but then after that realized that their hand and the dog's junk were in the photo and so they needed to white that out... also there's a power cord(?) hanging above the bed(?) looking like a clothesline...

Sorry pup you deserve better.

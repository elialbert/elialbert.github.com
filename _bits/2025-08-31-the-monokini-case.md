I like an iphone case for a couple reasons - phone doesn’t wobble when you lay it flat, better grip. Some drop protection is nice on the corners - I don’t drop my phones that much.

I hate cases because it’s fun to see and touch the fancy premium metal and glass and we cover it up instead. 

So may I present to you my $0 innovation, the monokini case - you just cut your phone case with your kitchen scissors, in the pattern of these pictures. 

![](/assets/uploads/IMG_5504.jpeg)I had an extra case to cut into and I really thought this would be a silly gag but it’s turned into my favorite thing ever. Basically just cut the sides off but leave a small strip connecting top and bottom down the center. I know you can buy an Arc Pulse for $100 and that money gets you precision engineering so the bikini case stays on top and bottom, but this is free and also stays on due to the monokini connecting strap. Looks like a wine glass. 

This case gives me all the upsides of a case, and all the upsides of the naked life, and I really recommend it. While it does look silly, it also shows off the phone materials, so I think that cancels out.

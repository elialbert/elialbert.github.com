<a href="http://www.github.com/elialbert">My work on Github</a>
</p>
<p>
Here's a current project, <a href="http://www.simplerelevance.com">SimpleRelevance</a>. I am VP of Technology and lead developer. I do machine learning / algorithmic backend work as well as client management / registration / communication.<br/>
If you go to the <a href="http://www.simplerelevance.com/products">products page</a> you can see some fun little demos of things I've made in my 20 percent time.
</p>
<p>
Here's a page for a new project I'm working on: <a href="http://UpChicago.org">UpChicago.org</a>. That's me learning how to be a web designer.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and here's another example of my measly but hilarious web design chops: <a href="http://www.theribcage.net">the ribcage</a>. It's the home page for my house.

This is the initial spike for a jquery plugin that uses twitter and the clients' computers to host, manage, and display comments for the given website (free commenting for small self-run and self-hosted sites): <a href="https://bitbucket.org/elialbert/jeasycom/src/561c3cf46119/jeasytest/jeasycomtest/static/jeasyCom.js">JeasyCom</a>
</p>
<p>
I also have a <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/elialbert">bitbucket account</a> with more repositories. I have been building up various API wrappers in Python/Django for things like IContact, Constantcontact, Mailchimp, Magento, XCom, EmailDirect, among others, (mostly for work) and I hope to release them all very soon.

Sometimes I write down difficult fixes for things in a blog which you can find <a href="http://creaturefeaturecode.blogspot.com">here</a>.

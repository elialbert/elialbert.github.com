<a href="http://www.github.com/elialbert">My work on Github</a>
</p>
<p>
Here's my last full time job, which I held for 4 years (currently staying on in an hourly contractor role), <a href="http://www.simplerelevance.com">SimpleRelevance</a>. I was Chief Architect. I do webdev / machine learning / algorithmic backend work; previously managed the tech team but decided to focus on coding.<br/>
If you go to the <a href="http://www.simplerelevance.com/api_doc">api doc</a> you can see how this stuff works from a developer's perspective.
</p>
<p>
Here's my newest angular firebase project - a realtime multiplayer fridge magnet game - <a href="http://fridgemagnetswithfriends.com">check it out</a>! I'm really happy with it. And <a href="https://github.com/elialbert/fridgemagnets">here's</a> the source.
</p>
<p>
Here's my first angular firebase project - facebook API using, cloud backed fb event management app I'm temporarily calling 3vent. <strike>It's up at events.upchicago.org</strike> never mind, facebook broke their API. The code is <a href="https://github.com/elialbert/kissandtell">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm also currently teaching myself game coding and in-browser js graphics - <a href="http://bikegame.upchicago.org">this</a> is my current ongoing project, an attempt to make a flexible 2d citybiking simulator, to help people get used to biking in a city and thinking through things like biking through difficult intersections without getting killed. You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/elialbert/citybiking">here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Oh, and here's another example of my measly but quickly improving design chops: <a href="http://ribcage.upchicago.org">the ribcage</a>. It's the home page for my (former) house. <a href="http://chichico.org">And another small website I made and maintain</a>. And I made the website for <a href="http://cavepaintersmusic.com">my band</a>. And I'm currently working on a side project for the BMORG, the <a href="burnerbroadcastnetwork.appspot.com">Burner Broadcasting Network</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is the initial spike for a jquery plugin that uses twitter and the clients' computers to host, manage, and display comments for the given website (free commenting for small self-run and self-hosted sites): <a href="https://bitbucket.org/elialbert/jeasycom/src/561c3cf46119/jeasytest/jeasycomtest/static/jeasyCom.js">JeasyCom</a>. I wrote it a million years ago.
</p>
<p>
I also have a <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/elialbert">bitbucket account</a> with more repositories. I have been building up various API wrappers in Python/Django for things like IContact, Constantcontact, Mailchimp, Magento, XCom, EmailDirect, Shopify, BigCommerce, ExactTarget, etc etc, (mostly for work) and I hope to release them all very soon.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I write down difficult fixes for things in a blog which you can find <a href="http://creaturefeaturecode.blogspot.com">here</a>.

<a href="http://www.github.com/elialbert">My work on Github</a>
</p>
<p>
Here's a current project, <a href="http://www.simplerelevance.com">SimpleRelevance</a>. I am VP of Technology and lead developer. I do <i>all</i> of the machine learning / algorithmic backend work as well as client management / registration / communication.
</p>
<p>
Here's a fun little page I made called <a href="http://www.wowwhataterriblehumanbeing.com">Wow, What a Terrible Human Being</a> to teach myself django.

This is the initial spike for a jquery plugin that uses twitter and the clients' computers to host, manage, and display comments for the given website (free commenting for small self-run and self-hosted sites): <a href="https://bitbucket.org/elialbert/jeasycom/src/561c3cf46119/jeasytest/jeasycomtest/static/jeasyCom.js">JeasyCom</a>
</p>
<p>
Here's a recent project, <a href="http://www.Koaladeal.com">Koaladeal</a>.
</p>
<p>
I also have a <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org/elialbert">bitbucket account</a> with more repositories. I have been building up various API wrappers in Python for things like IContact, Constantcontact, Mailchimp, and Magento (mostly for SimpleRelevance) and I plan to release them all very soon.

Sometimes I write down difficult fixes for things in a blog which you can find <a href="http://creaturefeaturecode.blogspot.com">here</a>.
